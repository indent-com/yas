# Embedding

There are two distinct dimensions: embedding the frontend into your app, and embedding `yas server` into your own service.

## Your app, our components: `@yas-run/react` / `@yas-run/solid`

`@yas-run/react` and `@yas-run/solid` are workspace-first. Both are thin wrappers over `@yas-run/core`'s `YasTerminalSurface`. A `YasWorkspace` owns connections, each connection owns terminals, and each `YasTerminal` renders a terminal by ID.

```tsx
import {
  YasTerminal,
  YasWorkspaceProvider,
  useYasFocusedSession,
  useYasSessions,
  useYasWorkspace,
} from "@yas-run/react";
import { YasWorkspace } from "@yas-run/core";
import { useEffect, useMemo } from "react";

function EmbeddedYas({ wasm, passphrase }: { wasm: any; passphrase: string }) {
  const workspace = useMemo(
    () =>
      new YasWorkspace({
        wasm,
        connections: [
          {
            id: "default",
            transport: {
              type: "websocket",
              url: "wss://example.com/edge",
              passphrase,
            },
          },
        ],
      }),
    [passphrase, wasm],
  );

  useEffect(() => () => workspace.dispose(), [workspace]);

  return (
    <YasWorkspaceProvider workspace={workspace}>
      <TerminalScreen />
    </YasWorkspaceProvider>
  );
}

function TerminalScreen() {
  const workspace = useYasWorkspace();
  const sessions = useYasSessions();
  const focusedSession = useYasFocusedSession();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (sessions.length > 0) return;
    void workspace.createSession({
      connectionId: "default",
      rows: 24,
      cols: 80,
    });
  }, [sessions.length, workspace]);

  return (
    <YasTerminal
      sessionId={focusedSession?.id ?? null}
      style={{ width: "100%", height: "100vh" }}
    />
  );
}
```

Read-only terminals use the same sizing behavior as writable terminals; `readOnly` only disables mutating input. Terminals resize the remote session to their available grid by default. The grid stays at native size in the top-left corner of its container, with excess content clipped while a resize is pending. Pass `resizable={false}` for passive views or read-only transports that must preserve the host dimensions; this keeps the same native-size presentation. Add `fitWidth` to opt a passive preview into scaling and centering to fill the container's width, as used by the right-sidebar and Cmd-K B switcher previews. Use a flex container to center the preview vertically within a fixed height.

### Wayland surface rendering (experimental)

`YasSurfaceView` renders a single Wayland surface from a terminal's compositor. The server encodes each surface as H.264 or AV1; the component decodes via WebCodecs and draws to a canvas.

By default the view participates in sizing its surface: the largest logical
rectangle that fits all active viewers is requested, subject to the application's
minimum/maximum size hints. The view is fully interactive. Pass
`resizable={false}` for a passive preview — a dock card, a switcher thumbnail —
that shares another view's stream.
Such a view is served a fixed downscale capped at a thumbnail cadence and takes
no input at all, so it is the wrong choice for anything the user clicks in.

`zoom` scales the surface independently of the pane's pixel size: `zoomMode`
`"relative"` (the default) multiplies the display's DPI by `zoom`, while
`"exact"` uses `zoom` as the absolute surface scale. Only resizable views drive
the scale.

Resizable views display decoded pixels 1:1 when codec rounding leaves the
frame within two device pixels of its intended size on both axes. This avoids
an extra browser resize on lower-DPI viewers sharing a HiDPI surface; a small
gap at the right or bottom is preferable to filtering the text again.
Adaptive frames with substantially lower resolution still fill their logical
window size, anchored at the top-left. While a resize is in flight, the old
frame keeps its intended scale and is clipped by the pane until the resized
frame arrives. Only a committed application minimum forces uniform zoom-out;
an oversized frame alone never does.
Smaller windows stay at their intended scale rather than filling unused space.
Minimum-forced zoom-out also expands the logical size offered to the application:
if width forces a 360×780 pane to fit a 500px-wide window, it offers approximately
1083 logical pixels of height. These adjusted bounds are intersected across
viewers, and reset when the application releases its minimum.

```tsx
import { YasSurfaceView } from "@yas-run/react";

function AppWindow({
  connectionId,
  surfaceId,
}: {
  connectionId: string;
  surfaceId: number;
}) {
  return (
    <YasSurfaceView
      connectionId={connectionId}
      surfaceId={surfaceId}
      style={{ width: 800, height: 600 }}
    />
  );
}
```

`touchMode` chooses how touchscreen contacts reach the app. The default,
`"direct"`, forwards every contact to the app's own `wl_touch`, so pinch,
rotate, and multi-finger gestures belong to the app. Set `"pointer"` to opt out
and use YAS's compatibility gestures: tap to click, one-finger drag to scroll,
and long-press for right-click. A server without multitouch support
automatically keeps the pointer mapping. The mode is safe to change at runtime
and does not restart the video stream. Trackpads and pens are unaffected.

```tsx
<YasSurfaceView
  connectionId={connectionId}
  surfaceId={surfaceId}
  touchMode="pointer"
/>
```

Every terminal has an experimental Wayland compositor available. Any command — shell, TUI, or GUI — can open Wayland surfaces:

```tsx
workspace.createSession({
  connectionId: "default",
  rows: 24,
  cols: 80,
  command: "my-gui-app",
});
```

Surfaces created by the terminal appear in the connection's `surfaceStore`, keyed by the terminal's PTY ID. Each surface has a `surfaceId`, `parentId`, `title`, `appId`, `width`, and `height`.

### Workspace operations

- `createSession({ connectionId, rows, cols, tag?, command?, cwdFromSessionId? })`
- `closeSession(sessionId)`
- `restartSession(sessionId)`
- `focusSession(sessionId | null)`
- `search(query, { connectionId? })`
- `setVisibleSessions(sessionIds)`
- `addConnection(...)` / `removeConnection(connectionId)` / `reconnectConnection(connectionId)`

### Transports

All transports share a common set of options (`YasTransportOptions`):

| Option              | Default                      | Description                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `reconnect`         | `true`                       | Auto-reconnect on disconnect |
| `reconnectDelay`    | `500`                        | Initial reconnect delay (ms) |
| `maxReconnectDelay` | `10000`                      | Maximum reconnect delay (ms) |
| `reconnectBackoff`  | `1.5`                        | Backoff multiplier           |
| `connectTimeoutMs`  | none (WS) / `10000` (WebRTC) | Connection timeout (ms)      |

```ts
// Authenticated native YAS edge.
const edge = { type: "websocket", url, passphrase, options };

// Native read-only WebRTC share through the signaling hub.
const share = { type: "share", hubUrl, passphrase };

// Low-level native byte-stream transport for an existing peer connection.
const dataChannel = createWebRtcDataChannelTransport(peerConnection);
// Its ordered channel selector is `yas.v1`.
```

Or implement your own:

```ts
interface YasTransport {
  connect(): void;
  send(data: Uint8Array): void;
  close(): void;
  readonly status: ConnectionStatus;
  readonly authRejected: boolean;
  readonly lastError: string | null;
  addEventListener(type: "message" | "statuschange", listener: Function): void;
  removeEventListener(
    type: "message" | "statuschange",
    listener: Function,
  ): void;
}
```

## Server-side: a Node/Bun client over a unix socket

You can also run a `@yas-run/core` client **server-side** (Node/Bun/Deno) to drive a
local `yas server` over its unix-domain socket — e.g. to script terminals or run
headless commands. The non-browser building blocks live under the
`@yas-run/core/node` subpath (kept out of the package root so `node:net` and
runtime globals never leak into browser bundles):

```ts
import { YasWorkspace, exitCodeFromStatus, nullLogger } from "@yas-run/core";
import { NodeUnixSocketTransport, loadYasWasm } from "@yas-run/core/node";

// `loadYasWasm()` initializes the @yas-run/browser WASM off-browser: it reads
// the colocated yas_browser_bg.wasm from disk and feeds it to init(), so you
// never touch raw wasm bytes. (If you depend on a self-initializing
// `@yas-run/browser/node` build it is returned as-is.)
const wasm = await loadYasWasm();

const socket = process.env.YAS_SOCK;
if (!socket) {
  throw new Error("YAS_SOCK must name the server's explicit Unix socket");
}
const transport = new NodeUnixSocketTransport(socket);
const workspace = new YasWorkspace({
  wasm,
  logger: nullLogger, // no-op logger; omit to log lifecycle events to console
  connections: [{ id: "default", transport }],
});

const session = await workspace.createSession({
  connectionId: "default",
  rows: 24,
  cols: 80,
  command: "my-command",
});
```

The unix transport speaks yas's framing protocol (4-byte little-endian
length-prefixed frames) for you — there is no need to re-implement the wire
format. `BunUnixSocketTransport` and `DenoUnixSocketTransport` are the
runtime-native equivalents.

### Exit status

When a session's process exits, its `YasSession.state` becomes `"exited"` and
`YasSession.exitStatus` carries the raw status from the server:

- `>= 0` — normal exit; the value is the exit code.
- `< 0` — terminated by a signal; the value is the negated signal number.
- `EXIT_STATUS_UNKNOWN` — not yet collected.

`exitCodeFromStatus(status)` maps that to a conventional shell exit code
(unknown → `1`, signalled → `128 + signal`), and `formatExitStatus(status)`
renders `"exited(<code>)"` / `"signal(<n>)"`. Both mirror the `yas` CLI.

```ts
import { exitCodeFromStatus } from "@yas-run/core";

workspace.subscribe(() => {
  for (const s of workspace.getSnapshot().sessions) {
    if (s.state === "exited" && s.exitStatus !== null) {
      console.log(`${s.id} exited with code`, exitCodeFromStatus(s.exitStatus));
    }
  }
});
```

## Your service, our server: `fd-channel` mode

`fd-channel` lets an external process own `yas server`'s lifecycle and control which clients connect via `SCM_RIGHTS` fd passing. See the [transport reference](docs/transports.md#fd-channel) and the working examples:

- [Python](examples/fd-channel-python.py)
- [Bun](examples/fd-channel-bun.ts)

## Uplink connections

`@yas-run/core/transports` exports `YasUplinkTransport`, which connects directly
through an uplink relay using browser WebCrypto (X25519, AES-GCM, SHA-256).
Pass the producer's pinned connection URL and the client's 43-character
base64url private key separately: `new YasUplinkTransport(url, privateKey)`.
`generateUplinkKeyPair()` generates an identity and `uplinkPublicKey(privateKey)`
derives its public key. Authorize that public key on the producer.

`YasWorkspace` accepts the equivalent
`{ type: "uplink", url, identity: privateKey }` transport configuration.
Identity storage belongs to the embedding app; the transport does not persist
keys. The app must be served from a trusted origin independently of the relay,
and the relay control endpoint must permit that origin through CORS.

`YasNoiseTransport` wraps custom opaque carriers and supports optional encrypted
routed datagrams. See [the uplink protocol](docs/uplink.md#browser-embedding) for
carrier requirements, limits, key rotation, and migration from Ed25519/TLS.
