/**
 * Drag-and-drop of pane assignments.
 *
 * Any element that opens a tile on click (an explorer file, a changed file, a
 * problem, a commit, a reference) can also be *dragged* onto a pane to open
 * there instead of the default target. Sources call {@link startTileDrag} with
 * the same assignment they'd pass to `onOpenTile`; pane drop zones read it with
 * {@link tileDragAssignment} and route it to that specific pane.
 *
 * The payload is a pane assignment, not strictly an IDE tile: the preview
 * panel's parked cards drag terminals (a bare session id) and surfaces the
 * same way, since a pane assignment holds any of them and LayoutContainer's
 * moveToPane is agnostic. Hence the deliberately dumb payload — one opaque
 * string, interpreted only where it lands.
