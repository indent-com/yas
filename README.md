# yas

Terminal multiplexer and experimental Wayland compositor for browsers and AI agents. Nothing to configure, no required dependencies.

Wayland surfaces support [Display-P3 and HDR](docs/color.md), with SDR fallback for other viewers.

We publish a [computer agent skill](https://yas.run/SKILL.md).

Install and run locally:

```bash
curl -sf https://yas.run | sh
yas open # opens a browser
```

Share over WebRTC:

```bash
yas share # prints a URL anyone can open
```

For full-control access through an untrusted relay, `yas uplink` requires
mutually pinned X25519 identities and encrypts the YAS session end to end
with Noise IK and AES-256-GCM. On each endpoint, set
`YAS_UPLINK_IDENTITY` from `yas uplink-keygen --private`, and print its public
key with `yas uplink-public-key`. The producer can generate a connection URL
with `yas uplink-url`. Exchange public keys independently of the relay and
follow [uplink setup](docs/uplink.md). Existing bearer-only uplinks
must configure keys; there is no plaintext fallback.

Manage named remotes and connect to them:

```bash
yas remote add rabbit ssh:rabbit          # save a named remote
yas remote add prod ssh:alice@prod.co     # another one
yas remote add work local:work            # a named local server
yas remote list                           # show all remotes
yas remote set-default rabbit             # make rabbit the CLI default

yas open                                  # local + all configured remotes
yas terminal list                         # lists terminals on rabbit
yas --on prod terminal list               # one-off override
yas --on ssh:newhost terminal list        # full URI also works
```

The CLI default remote is stored in `~/.config/yas/yas.conf` as
`yas.target = rabbit` and can also be set via the `YAS_TARGET` environment
variable. Named remotes live in the home server's own KV store, under the
`remotes` key, which is per instance; the server watches it and publishes all
routes over Relay. Any client of that server can read the stored URIs,
credentials included.
`yas open` shows the home server and its routes; the modern browser keeps its
active route selection in the attached backend workspace, alongside
its layout and panel state. The browser URL names only that session. SSH
remotes are auto-installed on first connection.
`local:NAME` entries work in both the CLI and the home server's Relay
catalogue.

Forward ports to whatever the server can reach — `ssh -L` over any yas
transport, plus UDP:

```bash
yas forward 8080:localhost:3000                # local 8080 → server's :3000
yas forward 8080:localhost:3000 5432:db:5432    # a list, over one connection
yas forward udp/5353:resolver.internal:53       # UDP too
yas forward add web 8080:localhost:3000         # remember it
yas forward --all                               # start every saved forward
```

Or proxy everything the server can reach through one port — `ssh -D`:

```bash
yas socks 1080                                  # SOCKS5 on 127.0.0.1:1080
curl -x socks5h://localhost:1080 http://api.internal/
```

Names are resolved on the server, so `socks5h://` (or a browser set to proxy
DNS) reaches hosts your machine cannot look up.

Listeners bind to loopback unless you name a bind address. The relay reaches
whatever the server reaches; restrict it with
`yas server --allow-forward 'host[:ports]'`. Saved forwards live in
`~/.config/yas/yas.forwards` (mode 0600). See
[docs/design/net.md](docs/design/net.md).

Control terminals programmatically:

```bash
yas terminal start htop # start a terminal, print its ID
yas terminal show 1     # dump current terminal text
yas terminal send 1 q   # send keystrokes
yas terminal journal 1  # commands the shell has run (needs OSC 133)
yas terminal output 1 --wait 60  # that command's output
```

Interact with the `muster` supervisor in a terminal UI:

```bash
yas mustard
```

Install, update, or uninstall persistent extensions with an
inline mouse-and-keyboard picker:

```bash
yas ext manage
yas ext manage --from http://localhost:10003/ext # development registry
```

Navigate stacks, units, current and retained terminals, and windows; inspect
live terminal output and send input without leaving the UI.
The Muster list fits its expanded rows; panels share compact separators.
Drag the Events header to resize it, down to a single header line. Scroll a
terminal with the mouse wheel or PageUp/PageDown. While sending terminal
input, use Shift+PageUp/PageDown; Shift+Home/End jumps to oldest/latest output.
Typing returns to latest output. Focused mouse-aware applications receive
normal wheel events; Shift+wheel always scrolls history. Retained terminals
remain scrollable after exit. Press `?` in navigation mode for all controls.

Run a pipe-oriented process without a terminal, connecting its stdin, stdout,
and stderr and returning its exit code:

```bash
yas run --in /src/yas --env RUST_LOG=debug -- cargo test
```

`--in` selects the server-side working directory and `--env` is repeatable.
The program is executed directly; use an explicit shell when shell syntax is
needed.

Inspect and disconnect other clients attached to the same server:

```bash
yas client list
yas client disconnect "$SESSION_ID" --reason "duplicate browser tab"
```

In the browser, open the Ctrl/Cmd-K menu and choose **Connected clients** to
see a live list of every client's age, measured outbound bandwidth, audio,
filesystem, Git, LSP, KV, network, terminal, and surface subscriptions. Terminal
and surface entries include their requested view sizes. Disconnecting asks for
confirmation and lets you give the peer a reason.

Ordinary connections that can reach the private server socket receive the full
catalogue and may list or disconnect peers. Read-only `yas share` consumers use
a REQUIRED Core HELLO marker; the server itself selects a least-authority
catalogue and rejects every unadvertised operation. A share can observe the
selected Terminal, Surface, Media, and Font state, but cannot enumerate peers,
create or control resources, inject input, or shut down the server.

Run GUI apps — on Linux, every terminal includes an experimental headless Wayland compositor:

```bash
yas terminal start foot    # launch a Wayland terminal emulator
yas surface list           # list graphical windows
yas surface capture 1      # screenshot a surface
yas surface click 1 100 50 # click at (x, y)
yas surface type 1 "hello{Return}" # type into a GUI window
```

The server auto-starts when needed.

Run isolated local instances by giving the server a name, or address one as
`local:<name>` and let the client auto-start it:

```bash
yas server --name work
yas --on local:work terminal list
yas --on local:test terminal start htop # auto-starts a second instance
```

Every server has a name; omitting `--name` uses `default`. Each instance uses a
named socket and stores its KV database, installed extensions, and object cache
under `yas/instances/<name>/` in the platform state/cache directories. The
server holds an exclusive `kv.redb.server.lock` for that persistent instance;
a second server with the same state exits even if it was given another socket.
`@xdg-desktop` extension's intent is in that instance's KV database, while
`@muster` reads the corresponding platform configuration directory at
`yas/instances/<name>/muster/`. Explicit `YAS_SOCK`, `YAS_KV_PATH`,
`YAS_EXTENSION_PATH`, `YAS_WASM_CACHE`, and `YAS_MUSTER_DIR` overrides still
win. Add `--export-sock` if commands launched in an instance's terminals should
automatically target that instance.

## Supported platforms

For a GPU sandbox with Ubuntu, systemd, and browsers, see [YAS on Tensorlake](docs/tensorlake.md).

| Platform | Arch          | Wayland compositor | Notes                 |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Linux    | x86_64, arm64 | Yes                | Full features         |
| macOS    | arm64         | No                 | PTY multiplexing only |
| Windows  | x86_64        | No                 | PTY multiplexing only |

SSH remotes are auto-installed on first connection. Requirements on the remote:
`curl` or `wget`, CA certificates, and a supported OS/arch.

The embedded SSH client authenticates via ssh-agent (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) or key files
(`~/.ssh/id_{ed25519,ecdsa,rsa}`), and resolves `~/.ssh/config` for Hostname,
User, Port, and IdentityFile.

## Install

```bash
curl -sf https://yas.run | sh
```

The default binary is MIT-licensed (software H.264 via openh264). On Linux
you can opt into a GPL build that uses x264 (GPL-2.0-or-later) for better
software H.264 instead:

```bash
curl -sf https://yas.run | YAS_GPL=1 sh
```

Every binary prints its exact terms with `yas --license`.

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://yas.run/install.ps1 | iex
```

This downloads `yas.exe` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\yas\bin` and adds it to your user `PATH`. Set `YAS_INSTALL_DIR` to override the install location on Windows.

## How it works

`yas` hosts terminals and tracks their parsed state. Through the native Terminal
family, each browser watches complete lifecycle State and opens its own grid
view. The server sends sequenced keyframes or deltas in the negotiated grid
codec; deltas can use LZ4 compression, cell patches, and copy rectangles. The
browser validates and acknowledges applied frames, then renders them with
WebGL.

On Linux, every yas server includes an experimental headless Wayland compositor shared by all terminals. GUI applications launched inside any terminal (anything that speaks the Wayland protocol — terminal emulators, browsers, editors, media players) automatically connect to it. Surfaces are captured, encoded as H.264 or AV1 video, and streamed to connected browsers in real time. No X server, no display, no GPU required — rendering uses GPU compositing (Vulkan via dlopen) when available, with a CPU software fallback. Encoding uses openh264 or x264 (a build-time choice, see Install) and rav1e, with optional NVENC or VA-API hardware acceleration on Linux. The compositor is available on Linux only.

Each client is paced independently based on render metrics it reports back: display rate, frame apply time, backlog depth. A phone on 3G doesn't stall a workstation on localhost. The focused terminal gets full frame rate; background terminals throttle down. Keystrokes go straight to the PTY — latency is bounded by link RTT.

`yas open` opens the browser with an embedded YAS edge. For persistent browser
access, `yas edge` serves the web app and authenticates either its baseline
`yas.v1` WebSocket or an optional native WebTransport session. WebTransport
pairs the authoritative stream with QUIC datagrams; WebSocket keeps reliable
fallback delivery. Both adapt to one fixed native YAS home endpoint. Relay
routing and font service live in `yas server`; the edge has no destination mux,
configuration WebSocket, font side channel, or alternate wire protocol.
`yas server` can also run standalone for headless/daemon use. For embedding in
your own app,
[`@yas-run/react`](EMBEDDING.md) and [`@yas-run/solid`](EMBEDDING.md) provide
framework bindings.

The browser passphrase is a full-control credential, not a viewer token. A connected client can use every family the home server advertises, including opening every Relay route with credentials held by that server. Route URIs and credentials never enter route snapshots or routine errors in the default edge mode. Font export is enabled by default and remains subject to each face's OS/2 embedding restrictions; only exportable faces are listed. Set `YAS_FONT_EXPORT=0` to disable export and empty the font catalogue. Non-loopback deployments must protect every browser transport with TLS; exposing the default plaintext WebSocket listener to an untrusted network leaks full server authority. See the complete [trust model](docs/design/yas.md#trust-model).

`yas proxy-daemon` keeps reusable remote transport sessions alive across short-lived CLI invocations. In particular, `share:` retains one WebRTC ICE/DTLS/SCTP session per target while every command gets a fresh reliable DataChannel and an independent unreliable datagram DataChannel; SSH targets reuse their underlying SSH connection. The proxy auto-starts transparently on Unix and Windows — set `YAS_PROXY=0` to opt out.

For the native protocol entry point, see [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md);
the canonical contract is [docs/design/yas.md](docs/design/yas.md) plus the
[generated wire registry](protocol/yas/wire.md). System topology and transport
deployment are covered by [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[docs/transports.md](docs/transports.md).

### Surface video encoders

Set `yas server --surface-encoders` (or `YAS_SURFACE_ENCODERS`) to a
comma-separated priority list of encoders. The server tries each in order and
uses the first that works.

```bash
# Default priority (dedicated encode engines, compositor-resident, then software):
# av1-nvenc,h264-nvenc,av1-vaapi,h264-vaapi,av1-vulkan,h264-vulkan,h264-software,av1-software

# Force software AV1 only:
YAS_SURFACE_ENCODERS=av1-software

# Prefer NVENC, fall back to software:
YAS_SURFACE_ENCODERS=av1-nvenc,h264-nvenc,h264-software

# Same, as a flag — a typo here stops the server instead of being ignored:
yas server --surface-encoders av1-nvenc,h264-nvenc,h264-software
```

The other direction — what viewers may send from their camera and microphone —
is `--camera-codecs` / `--microphone-codecs` (or `YAS_MEDIA_CAMERA_CODECS` /
`YAS_MEDIA_MICROPHONE_CODECS`). Viewers choose within what both ends allow,
from the media panel. See [docs/server.md](docs/server.md).

| `av1-software`  | AV1   | rav1e (software) | 3840×2160      | CPU-bound; capped to stay interactive                                                      |

The browser automatically detects the codec from each frame and configures
its WebCodecs decoder accordingly. Clients advertise which codecs they
support and the largest frame they can decode; the server skips encoders the
client can't decode.

The resolution ceiling is per viewer, not per surface. At ordinary display
scales a surface is composited at whatever its most capable subscriber can
receive — so an AV1 client on a 5K display gets a native 5120×2880 stream —
and any viewer whose encoder or decoder stops lower is served an
aspect-preserving downscale of that same surface rather than dragging it down
for everyone. At a sub-1× zoom the 1× compositor source may be larger than the
encode ceiling; the viewer still receives only its viewport-sized downscale.
Clients that don't report a decode ceiling (anything predating the field)
stay at 3840×2160.

For `yas edge` configuration, running as a systemd/launchd service, and Nix module setup, see [SERVICES.md](SERVICES.md) and [`nix/README.md`](nix/README.md).

### Optional dependencies

yas has no required dependencies — software H.264 and AV1 encoders are statically linked, and the CPU software renderer works everywhere. GPU acceleration and audio are enabled automatically when the right libraries or binaries are present. All GPU libraries are loaded at runtime via `dlopen`; missing ones are silently skipped.

**Video — GPU compositing and hardware encoding (Linux)**

| Library                                 | Used for                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `libvulkan.so.1`                        | GPU compositing, Vulkan Video encode             |
| `libva.so.2`, `libva-drm.so.2`          | VA-API hardware encode (Intel/AMD)               |
| `libgbm.so.1`                           | DMA-BUF allocation for zero-copy VA-API encoding |
| `libcuda.so.1`, `libnvidia-encode.so.1` | NVENC hardware encode                            |

Without any of the above, the compositor falls back to CPU rendering and software encoding. No configuration needed.

**Desktop services and audio (Linux)**

| Dependency             | Used for                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `pipewire`             | Audio daemon (private instance per compositor)    |
| `pipewire-pulse`       | PulseAudio compatibility for apps                 |
| `libpipewire-0.3.so.0` | Monitor capture (in-process, loaded via `dlopen`) |
| `dbus-daemon`          | Private desktop and PipeWire D-Bus sessions       |
| `wireplumber`          | Session manager (optional, started if available)  |
| `xwayland-satellite`   | X11 applications (optional, started if available) |

Audio is disabled automatically when PipeWire is not installed or `libpipewire-0.3.so.0` is not resolvable via `ld.so` (set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` if you have it in a non-default location), or explicitly with `YAS_AUDIO=0`.

X11 applications run through `xwayland-satellite`, which yas starts once per session when the binary is on `PATH` and exports the resulting `DISPLAY` to every terminal. Wayland stays the first choice for anything that speaks it; X11 is the fallback behind it. Without the binary, sessions are Wayland-only and no `DISPLAY` is exported. Set `YAS_XWAYLAND=0` to opt out.

## Browser tips

### Disable Ctrl+W tab close (Chrome / Brave / Edge)

When using yas in the browser, `Ctrl+W` closes the browser tab instead of
reaching your terminal. Chromium-based browsers let you disable this:

1. Navigate to `chrome://settings/system/shortcuts`
   (or `brave://settings/system/shortcuts` in Brave)
2. Find the **Close Tab** shortcut and remove or reassign it

This frees `Ctrl+W` for terminal use (e.g. deleting a word in bash/zsh).
